### Hi there 👋

My name is David Ivkovic and this is the place where I keep all my projects.

Let's talk about Kafka, Kubernetes, Cassandra, Cloud patterns, Javascript and any other cool stuff. </br>
React is slow. VDOM and Components are pure overhead. Respect your customers. Ship less JS. </br>
Really enyoing C#.


- 🌱 I’m currently working on a serverless Google Maps popularity crawler/aggregator using a custom proxy pool. Going public soon™️
- 🔭 Continuously studying System Design, Microservices and efficient Event Sourcing and CQRS approaches.
- ⌚ Lately I've also been looking at fine-grained Javascript reactivity and frontend performance optimization, such as Svelte, SolidJS, Astro and Qwik, inspired by [@ryansolid](https://github.com/ryansolid).
- 🤔 Also interested in working on native microservice oriented solutions such as .NET Native AOT and Quarkus.
